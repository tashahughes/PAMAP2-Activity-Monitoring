# PAMAP2-Activity-Monitoring
Submitted as part of Data Science Research Methods Module

Using the PAMAP2 activity dataset, the idea was to create a model which could correctly classify which activity was being done. This attempt uses the Random Forest Classifier, although an attempt at clustering was trialled (although it was not effective for this dataset)
